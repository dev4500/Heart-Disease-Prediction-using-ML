This Model predicts the possibility of Heart Disease of the User by taking input from the user as follows 

**Age:** The age of the patient.
**Sex:** The gender of the patient.
**Chest pain type:** A categorical attribute indicating the type of chest pain experienced by the patient. It has four possible values.
**Resting blood pressure:** The resting blood pressure of the patient.
**Serum cholesterol**: The serum cholesterol level in mg/dl of the patient.
**Fasting blood sugar:** Indicates whether the patient's fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl.
**Resting electrocardiographic results:** A categorical attribute representing the results of the resting electrocardiogram. It has three possible values.
**Maximum heart rate achieved:** The maximum heart rate achieved by the patient.
**Exercise induced angina:** Indicates whether the patient experienced angina (chest pain) induced by exercise.
**Oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
**Slope:** The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
**Number of major vessels**: Represents the number of major blood vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ranging from 0 to 3).
**Thal:** A categorical attribute indicating the thalassemia type of the patient. It has three possible values: 0 for normal, 1 for fixed defect, and 2 for reversible defect.
**Target:** The target column serves as the outcome variable and indicates the presence of heart disease in the patient. A value of 0 signifies the absence of heart disease, while a value of 1 indicates the presence of heart disease.

This model works on Machine Learning Algorithms like Logistic Regression and RandomForest Classifier (more accurate)
